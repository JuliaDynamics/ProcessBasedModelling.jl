It is an alternative framework to MTK's native component-based modelling, but, instead of components, there are \"processes\". This approach is useful in the modelling of physical/biological/whatever systems, where each variable corresponds to a particular physical concept or observable and there are few (or none) duplicate variables to make the definition of MTK \"factories\" worthwhile. On the other hand, there plenty of different physical representations, or processes to represent a given physical concept in equation form. In many scientific fields this approach parallels the modelling reasoning of the researcher more closely than the \"components\" approach.\n\nBeyond this reasoning style, the biggest strength of ProcessBasedModelling.jl is the informative errors and automation it provides regarding incorrect/incomplete equations. When building the MTK model via ProcessBasedModelling.jl the user provides a vector of \"processes\": equations or custom types that have a well defined and single left-hand-side variable. This allows ProcessBasedModelling.jl to:\n\nIterate over the processes and collect new variables that have been introduced by a provided process but do not themselves have a process assigned to them.\nFor these collected \"process-less\" variables:\nIf there is a default process defined, incorporate this one into the model\nIf there is no default process but the variable has a default value, equate the variable to a parameter that has the same default value and throw an informative warning.\nElse, throw an informative error saying exactly which originally provided variable introduced this new \"process-less\" variable.\nThrow an informative error if a variable has two processes assigned to it (by mistake).\n\nIn our experience, and as we also highlight explicitly in the online documentation, this approach typically yields simpler, less ambiguous, and more targeted warning or error messages than the native MTK one's. This leads to faster identification and resolution of the problems with the composed equations.\n\nProcessBasedModelling.jl is particularly suited for developing a model about a physical/biological/whatever system and being able to try various physical \"rules\" (couplings, feedbacks, mechanisms, ...) for a given physical observable efficiently. This means switching arbitrarily between different processes that correspond to the same variable. Hence, the target application of ProcessBasedModelling.jl is to be a framework to develop field-specific libraries that offer predefined processes without themselves relying on the existence of context-specific predefined components. An example usage is in ConceptualClimateModels.jl.\n\nBesides the informative errors, ProcessBasedModelling.jl also\n\nProvides a couple of common process subtypes out of the box to accelerate development of field-specific libraries.\nMakes named MTK variables and parameters automatically, corresponding to parameters introduced by the by-default provided processes. This typically leads to intuitive names without being explicitly coded, while being possible to opt-out.\nProvides some utility functions for further building field-specific libraries.\n\nSee the documentation online for details on how to use this package as well as examples highlighting its usefulness.\n\nProcessBasedModelling.jl development is funded by UKRI's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, grant no. EP/Y01653X/1 (grant agreement for a EU Marie Sklodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship for George Datseris).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"","page":"Documentation","title":"Documentation","text":"note: Basic familiarity with ModelingToolkit.jl\nThese docs assume that you have some basic familiarity with ModelingToolkit.jl.
